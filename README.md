I had created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch, as it offers a flexible and intuitive framework for building neural networks. We'll use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a standard benchmark for image classification, containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (e.g., airplane, car, bird, etc.). The code will include data loading, model definition, training, and performance evaluation with sample output.
